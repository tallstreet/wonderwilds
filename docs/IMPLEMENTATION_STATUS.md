# Wonderwilds implementation evidence

Foundation evidence recorded 28 October 2026; integration updates dated below. Broader roadmap: [Wonderwilds implementation plan](WONDERWILDS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) v1.1. Active gameplay sequence: [Companion progression plan](COMPANION_PROGRESSION_PLAN.md).
Six subagents implemented distinct scopes; the integration owner reviewed and
validated the combined changes. Existing source, guest saves and art are preserved.
No release, deployment, curriculum approval or learning-efficacy claim is made.

| Plan work | Current implementation | Remaining gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WW-01 | Baseline ADR, asset hashes/provenance inventory, synthetic save fixtures, desktop/tablet smoke | Independent rights review and child usability research |
| WW-02 | Pinned Rust workspace, closed schemas, generated serde/TS, OpenAPI, 51 shared fixtures and drift checks | Parent lifecycle API contracts expand with the selected provider |
| WW-03 | 33-node DAG, ladders, coverage/review ledgers, graph/bounds/hash validators | Educator prerequisite review, exact descriptor verification, release approval |
| WW-04 | Three chapter spines, 18 beats, 12 friends, supported ending, discovery and progression data | 23 missing art assets and human reviews; activation disabled |
| WW-05 | Pure domain engine, unique rewards, quests, collection/team/friendship/transformations, replay | Persist replay facts and validate actual world paths during browser integration |
| WW-06 | Six assessment families, bounded generation, explicit wire adapters, authored prompts, honest support | Educator calibration, broader item/context coverage and approved release pack |
| WW-07 | Experimental deterministic policy, frontier/enrichment, support/difficulty advice, replay checks | Calibrated policy, context/subject balance, durable recompute CLI and window-scoped freshness |
| WW-08 | PostgreSQL ownership/RLS, sessions/CSRF primitives, consent/export/delete adapters, tombstones, migration tooling | Reviewed identity provider, HTTP lifecycle flows, cleanup/retention workers, external-object deletion and backup recovery |
| WW-09 | Axum gameplay routes, actual DB transactions, idempotency/revisions, atomic evidence/rewards/outbox, auth boundaries | Full regional/world eligibility, production roles/TLS/provider, durable worker and full integration |
| WW-10 | Typed cloud client, exact retries, profile/logout cancellation, recoverable unverified import preparation | Real import endpoint and account/profile UX; no migration UI enabled |
| WW-11 | Six accessible DOM renderers, authored presentation binding, keyboard/touch controls, support-before-narration | Entrypoint/account integration, human screen-reader/accessibility review and complete browser journeys |
| WW-12 | Authored content and existing world preserved | New region/collection/team presentation integration and full playable ending |
| WW-13 | Bounded proposal validation, authored-only director/fallback, exact task binding and deterministic replay | API commit integration and approved content activation |
| WW-14–16 | Not implemented; authored game has no model dependency | Provider/privacy/budget decisions, adapter, evaluation corpus and gated training experiment |
| WW-17 | Existing guest parent view preserved; Rust summaries/client foundation available | New parent learning view, approved pack workflow and coverage dashboard |
| WW-18 | Local reproducible install/start/migration/check helpers | Deployment/CI, observability, backup restore and rollback drills, operational owner |
| WW-19–20 | Automated foundations and synthetic checks only | Integrated QA/security review, consented pilot, educator audit and measured curriculum expansion |

## Combined validation

`bash scripts/check.sh` passed Rust formatting and Clippy with warnings denied,
Rust unit/HTTP tests, both-language shared fixtures and code-generation drift,
14 curriculum tests and 8 story tests, frontend typecheck/lint/format/build,
7 existing frontend test files, 9 client/migration tests and 4 legacy fixture
tests. Default Rust tests explicitly exclude the two database-dependent tests;
`sh scripts/check-postgres.sh` executed both against a disposable local UTF8
PostgreSQL database, along with SQL ownership/export/deletion tests, repeated
migrations and negative migration-hash drift rejection. All selected checks passed.

Chromium desktop/tablet guest smoke and six-family activity component tests
passed. Component tests include keyboard controls, safe text, duplicate guards,
support-before-audio, failed support, editable answers and destroyed pending
callbacks. These are not a complete cloud-browser playthrough. The production
build retains the existing large Phaser bundle warning.

Integration review found and fixed equal-sharing schema uniqueness, parent-delete
RLS isolation, forgotten support history in mastery replay, late profile response
body races, noncanonical quest/skill mapping, cross-origin backslash URL
normalization and configuration-only readiness reporting. These concrete fixes
have regressions; they do not substitute for the plan's production security review.

## Development and release boundary

Only local synthetic databases were used. No child data, provider key, paid model
request, training run, deployment or publication occurred. The current browser
continues to use the existing local guest adventure. The Rust API exposes a
restricted authored Meadow development slice and fails closed without sessions.
Human approvals, reviewed art and provider/operational decisions cannot be
replaced by passing synthetic tests. New packs remain drafts and do not claim
complete curriculum coverage or secure mastery from repeated fixed practice.

## Independent review follow-up

An independent code review identified two defects in the initial foundation.
Encounter abandonment now has a real idempotent server command, persisted
unassessed evidence and domain cancellation, so leaving a task does not block
the next encounter. The authored director now excludes completed beats.
See `adr/encounter-abandonment.md` for protocol compatibility, regression coverage
and rollback limits. These fixes do not complete the outstanding release gates.

## Local browser integration — 29 October 2026

An opt-in `/demo.html` development screen now mounts the existing client and
activity components against the real PostgreSQL API. It exposes the existing
Meadow slice (six story beats, four friendships), server answer checks, recorded
support, abandonment, companion selection, inventory and learner summaries.
A separate synthetic database/session is provisioned by `scripts/local-demo.sh`;
the normal API authentication path is unchanged. Guest world saves remain separate.
This does not close the regional travel, world synchronization, account/import,
parent lifecycle, director, transformation or content-review gates listed above.

### In-world local integration

The default local demo now uses the Phaser world. Ten labelled interaction
points expose all six Meadow story beats and four friendships through walking,
clicking, Space and Missions. Server completions drive bridge collision/scenery,
picnic and garden changes. The journal and grown-up view use server snapshots;
selectedCompanions is an optional snapshot field populated from the domain team,
so followers restore after reload. Existing friend art is provisional.
Closing an activity records abandonment; uncertain writes retain their exact
command for retry, and pending encounters can resume after reload. Guest mode
remains at `?guest=1` with its original storage untouched by backend play.
Movement/camera/hero preferences are local; this does not assert server-verified
world reachability or add regional travel, transformations or account workflows.

### Visual activity interaction pass

The mounted activity components now use draggable/tappable planks, berries,
plates, number and letter tiles, and illustrated story/position cards. The UI
reuses local game art, shortens instructions and preserves accessible control
names and keyboard alternatives. Pointer dragging supports touch, return-to-tray
and ordered-card rearrangement; correctness and rewards remain server-owned.
This changes presentation, not assessment rules, and still requires educator
and child usability review.

## Companion progression planning update — 29 October 2026

The companion progression plan now defines the next gameplay work: per-character levels, training, collection presentation, teams, friendship/transformations and regional discovery. Existing domain systems are reused; individual character XP and training remain unimplemented. The frontend-first plan was replaced with a planning index, and obsolete foundation sequencing was removed from the broader roadmap. This documentation update adds no gameplay features or new application test results.
